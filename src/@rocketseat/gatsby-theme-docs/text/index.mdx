The media lab is an interdisciplinary centre within the Department of Design, IIT Guwahati.
Started with a primary focus on audio, video, new media and technology, the lab now also works within the fields of speculative design, indigenous knowledge, cultural analysis and pedagogy. 
It is a site of non-formal learning practices that follows a ‘research by practice’ methodology and strives to achieve a creative use of new technologies by providing a collaborative environment for research and experimentation at the intersection of art, technology, and culture.
