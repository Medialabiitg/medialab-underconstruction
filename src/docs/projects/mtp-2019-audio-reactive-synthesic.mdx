With the onset of the information Age, we have witnessed various cultural shifts in the way we perceive, absorb, process or create art-forms, like paintings, sculptures or music.
Since its beginning, around Paleolithic age, when the purpose of art was mainly ritualistic and communicational, art has gone through a lot of transformation in its role and significance in society. For a long time, art-forms associated intimately with a medium to experiment and deliver a visual narrative to the viewer for participation and engagement -in order to experience and get a glimpse of an artist's expression. But, with the adoption and proliferation of digital systems and the global shift towards information, contemporary art is witnessing a recent upsurge in the use of various mixed media to deliver that artistic narrative.
Apart from the traditional physical medium -canvases, paper, acrylics, charcoal or oil, in essence, other modalities like data, sound and the technological advancement to manipulate the same, have started to come into play and serve the purpose of delivering the artistic narrative to the viewer by serving within the chronologically developed grammar.This project is an attempt at the exploration of these emergent mediums in the information age, within the domain of visual art, and its innate effects on human experience and engagement. This follows an investigative study and experimentation with the discovered medium and an attempt to deliver a narrative using the same.
