*performance, choreography,  set design, dramaturgy, kinesthetic empathy, rituals, masks and roles*

<br/><br/>

People are becoming increasingly stagnant. A lot of the modern technology we use during large amounts our lives allows, or even requires us to be stagnant. It isolates us, despite the promises of social media. 
In earlier times, people used to connect through rituals, song and dance. There is a certain experiential quality when content is felt by the body, through movement and action as opposed to just seeing, reading or listening. Through moving, being and performing there is an opportunity for empathy, realization and immersion.
The project aims to explore performance as a medium for people to interact with each other in a more visceral, direct and intimate way.  
The project will also attempt to take a dramaturgical approach to explore ways to invite people to break away from their current performance, or way of living, and enter different or alien performances.  By detaching from the roles that they play (knowingly or unknowingly, whether they choose to play the role or whether the role is demanded of them), people may be able to question their roles, their authenticity and/or achieve a respite from the roles they play every day.
