### 2014 | Masters Thesis Project

<br/><br/>

*performance, choreography,  set design, dramaturgy, kinesthetic empathy, rituals, masks and roles*

<br/><br/>

The project aims to explore visual communication as a narrative experience, and stop motion animation. The project looks forward to bringing back Mongolian cultural heritage through the depiction of the traditional musical instrument called “Morin khuur”. Along with this, the project is intended to help my understanding of storytelling, narratives, image-making, animation, music and film making. 
A larger goal of creating a unique experience using the above techniques, has led to a set of experiments, explorations, and the final result.
