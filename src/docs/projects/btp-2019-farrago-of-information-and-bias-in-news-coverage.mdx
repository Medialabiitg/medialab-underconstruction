A lot has been talked about the agenda-setting political behaviour of many popular news publishing organizations of India, especially during the last decade. These talks, however, are driven by peopleâ€™s personal opinions and accusations which certainly do not qualify as credible evidence of bias by these organizations. But the solution can neither be to follow any selected news source, nor to be less informed. It is, to be aware of how the editorial decisions of the sources we choose might be shaping our views. Therefore, there is a need of a data visualization which makes information more accessible and allows readers to form their own opinions. This project visualizes and compares the differences in news delivery by the news organizations of India - Times of India, NDTV, and India TV. The designed visualizations aim to highlight the presence of biases - gatekeeping, coverage, and statement, in the news coverage by Indian media. The scope of the present research is limited to the articles by the Times of India, NDTV, and India TV. These articles are the ones posted in the time period of October 1, 2018 - March 31, 2019 (i.e. 6 months) on the respective websites/web-archives of these news organizations, under the 'India News' section.
