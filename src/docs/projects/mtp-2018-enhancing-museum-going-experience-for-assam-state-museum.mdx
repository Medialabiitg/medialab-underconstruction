The future lies in the hands of the young and I agree that this saying hits the nail on the head when it comes to children visiting museums. Children are never too young to learn about our cultural heritage and the collections that represent its physical manifestation. Museums simply need to be more enjoyable and more appealing to children. Therein lies the greatest potential. 
Many people claim that museums are a place for children to have fun, and museum visitor researchers are well aware that this fun experience often leads to learning outcomes. Learning knows no boundaries, and museums can be considered as learning landscapes for children. If learning is viewed as a process of change in knowledge, attitudes, and values, then museums provide an ideal and provocative learning environment. Learning in the museum happens when children connect with interesting objects or experiences. 
This project is an attempt to understand the different factors that influence childrenâ€™s experiences in the Assam State Museum and design a solution that would provide a better learning and engaging experience to the children visiting the museum.
