Sound is a crucial part of our lives. It has its own effects on this universe in all sorts of audible and inaudible levels. Since it is not visible, common people tend not to know about it as much as they would know about light!
Keen interest in the field of music and nature has driven me to explore and understand the possibilities and potential of sound on humans and human-nature relationship.
Through this project, I want to observe the effects of anthrophony on this world, study to bring out facts from the vanishing ancient, pseudoscientific texts and further find new and meaningful gaps which could be bridged by application of sound in the form of media.
