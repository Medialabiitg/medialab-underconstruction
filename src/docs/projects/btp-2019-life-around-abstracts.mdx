Life Around Abstracts is an experimental art project based upon exploration and understanding of experiences majorly driven by visual and auditory senses.

It is based upon the concepts of Indian Aesthetics (Rasa and Dhvani Theory), Memory-Image concept (Projection Theory), and in connection with Surrealism and Strange Loop(s). 
The output that has been generated, is based upon the experiences that were encountered over the course of this project journey.
