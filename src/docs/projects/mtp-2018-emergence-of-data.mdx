The problem behind solving problems is the creation
of new problems resulting from the isolation of an
object from its network and the myopic study,
directed by its agenda subject to varying human
constructs. Hence, I decided to study the nature of
data itself without a predefinite direction.
Resulting in the study of different data types as a
series of experimental experiences that the user can
interact with in different ways.
The Google Story is a video looking at the way
‘Google’ changed over the years. The image of sound
is a generative image creator that converts an audio
clip into an image containing volume and frequency
information. Sonicwatch has a collection of different
tools that splits the incoming audio input into a set
of frequency bands which then drives a series of
visual switches. A text based chord sequencer. A
series of audiovisual experiences and animated video
loops are a few of the experiences I developed during
my final year of master’s using touchdesigner.
