*cultural ethnography, sufism, intangible cultural heritage*

It is difficult to define india without using the words diversity and multicultural society. Since time immemorial, India has hosted a plethora of cultures, subcultures and within them hundreds of rituals. 
As beautiful as it is, a multi cultural society comes with its own conflicts, often due to the gap between different cultures and geographic boundaries. But along with these, arise some unique blends of cultures which are not seen elsewhere. One such case is from the state of Assam. A saint from Sufi school of philosophy, Hazrat Meeran Shah came to Sibsagar region in the 17th Century. More commonly known as Ajan Fakir, his name is still known in the Brahmaputra Valley. Though a Muslim saint, he is known among and respected by both the Hindus as well as the Muslims of Assam. He forged unity among the different sections on the society by his unique devotional songs in Assamese language known as Jikirs. These Jikirs were a blend of local folk songs, Quranic teachings, the philosophy of Srimanta Sankardev. The Jikirs, which also has influences from the geeta, continue to be sung by Assamese people till date. 
I think that a tale of such an inclusive culture needs to be captured and retold. I aim to create a documentary revolving around this diversity and harmony.
