Increasingly, we live in a world where things are becoming more and more complicated. Simple jobs in order to be done require incomprehensible and intelligible actions. The simple sense of tangibility is declining. Credibility of information is also at an all time low, yet importance of the same exceeds everything else. Cyberpur is vision of the same world, where characters navigate through their lives trying to make sense of the world.
