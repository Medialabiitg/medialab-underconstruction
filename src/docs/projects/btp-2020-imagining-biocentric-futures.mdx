Human beings have designed the world by keeping themselves as the center of existence, and most of the world organizes itself from a western point of view. More often than not, it comprises capitalist and consumerist ideologies. Mass consumption and irresponsible usage are causing a depletion of natural resources. The waste generated from the current mass means of production and consumption is a major cause of climate change and animal extinction.
At a time like this, we need to organize ourselves to have a much more holistic and non-exploitative relationship with our environment and not a disruptive one. Our nature is creative, it organizes itself to create conditions to be self-sustaining. Nature is conducive to life.
This project follows a research-led design process through which I aim to study animal behavior and organization to speculate scenarios to create systems/narratives/products to invoke a biocentric way of thinking in people.
