Cinema is a vast field to study, having over 100 years of rich history. 
Before the audience views a film it undergoes several revisions, first by the script-writers, second by the actors and directors, and finally by the editor. This project is the study of historical evolution in script-writing and film editing i.e. study of the structure followed by a majority of films and examining how the evolution of non-linearity in the form of narratives breaks the standard notion of storytelling structures and presents a film creatively. It has compiled research in the form of video essays aimed at an audience of film studies or any film enthusiast with the intention to enhance their creativity using the art-form of editing.
