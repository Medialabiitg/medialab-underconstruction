“The cinema must film, not the world, but belief in this world, our only link. (…). Restoring our belief in the world – this is the power of cinema”
― Gilles Deleuze, Cinema 2: The Time-Image

The very concept of film as an art form misleads many people, to consider only the films which resemble traditional art forms which are free creations rather than explorations of nature. In such films, formative impulses are so strong, defeating the cinematic approach with its concern for camera-reality. It is exactly for these reasons that it is not good to be single minded about the potential of the filmmaker. In short, there is no standard definition for what can be considered cinematic. The essence of cinema lies in the fact that how efficiently a filmmaker uses his creative faculties to make the best of the medium's potential. Design constructs spaces, while film constructs a way of viewing those spaces in time. In this way, although design finds its base in fine art practices, it is more easily related to filmmaking in many aspects. It is important to note that they share basic design principles. These elements of design help build a solid foundation for a successful piece of design or film. 
Through experimenting and exploiting cinematic devices systematically by innovative design methods and techniques, this practise-led research attempts to delineate how the aesthetics of film works and is successful in creating ‘illusions’ through artistic tools and emotions. In addition, the project strives to visualize these elements in practise through a short fiction film/visual narrative, which not only represents the anxiety and trauma involved during a pandemic but also draws attention to the need for early sensitisation of public health experts to the psychological effects of a pandemic and how important it is to cater to the mental health needs of those affected, quarantined or in isolation.
