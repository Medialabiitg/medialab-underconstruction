The Government of India releases a huge amount of data under RTI. Consumer Price Index (CPI) is one such index released by the government. A Consumer Price Index (CPI) is designed to measure the changes over time in general level of retail prices of selected goods and services that households purchase for the purpose of consumption. It is an important indicator of inflation but it is released in the form of datasheets and tables. It is difficult for the public to make sense of it in this format. Some of the visualization tools that are available, are not as sophisticated as the data they represent. On the other hand, other tools are too sophisticated for the common man to make use of them. Therefore, there
is a need for a visualization that is sophisticated yet not very complex. There is a need to clarify things rather than simplify them. The designed visualization lies in between the two extremes and encodes the CPI in five different interactive visualizations. These visualizations allow the users to explore all the groups and subgroups of the Index. There is provision to select any of the 27 states and 7 Union territories. The data ranges from Jan 2013 to Jan 2019.
