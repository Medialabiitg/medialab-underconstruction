As we move more and more towards into 21st century we are seeing the digital media in the form of a tool for revolution and misinformation as well. More and more people in India are getting access to the digital landscape and without their knowledge, they are getting trapped in a larger system they are unaware of. Our project is a small study of the large landscape of digital media in India which is unregulated mostly. We intend to study the publically available Trending charts data on YouTube through Youtube data APIs and perform statistical and text mining operations over data collected over 72 days.
