The film Nerkik attempts to explore certain cultural aspects of the Mising tribe which are deeply rooted in their indigenous values. A festival of sowing seeds, which goes by Ali-Aye-Ligang, 'the commencement of sowing seeds and planting edible roots', is documented to present community values, practices, and most importantly, community resilience. It also reflects the Mising cosmology and their worldview in the process. 
The project also focuses on unfolding our perspectives on learning and the methods of learning. A nuanced understanding of the role of rituals and its interconnectedness to ecology.
