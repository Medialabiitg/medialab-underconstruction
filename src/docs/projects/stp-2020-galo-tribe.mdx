In recent years, due to huge amount of factors the environment has endured a lot of deterioration from us human beings. This in effect has affected the wildlife too in a major way. Exploration of a sustainable solution lead me along a pathway of the culture and traditions of tribes believing heavily in the forest spirits and animals as siblings and thereby not harming them. The thesis concerns the study of traditions of an aforementioned tribe, The Galo tribe of Arunachal Pradesh and their shift and continuity in the contemporary transitional time that is found to be expressed in different practices.
The indigenous tribe of Galo is one of the 26 major tribes of Arunachal Pradesh. Majority of the Galo live in the valleys of the upper mountain river, and a small fraction of them reside in the plains near the mountains. The Galo follow animistic religious practices and groups practice settled agriculture. Eventhough they speak the Adi language they are distinctly different from other Adi tribes present in the Siang River valley. Their diverse migration and settlement history and past demographic events suggest varied microevolutionary changes that are expected to be reflected in their genetic profiles.
The project is done undergoing the medium of ethnographic research in the mode of photography thereby getting a deeper and truer understanding of the Galo and their influence in sustainability of the environment and wildlife. By staying in their locality, conversing with the people and observing their cultural taboos and practices its potentiality can be understood.
