The project “Share-able” aims to re-establish the connection between the public spaces and the people and also among the people in the public spaces. A set of modular and unstable human scale structures, meant to be made stable by sharing. These unstable structures are a kind of social furniture which invokes some kind of social activity among strangers - exchange of words, sharing, concern to help or even an argument. Thus giving a social and playful dimension to the public space experience. The project was successfully implemented at places in and around the Department of Design, IIT Guwahati thus transforming them into active social places.
