The new age VR filmmaking is still being approached in the 2D format. The focus is much on the content and not on the filmmaking techniques thus the new degrees of freedom possible are not properly acquainted with this project is about exploring new visual grammar for generating Virtual Reality content.
The intention was to understand the new medium of Virtual Reality and all its complexities through exploration. Various aspects of narrative theory and Perceptual Virtuality have been explored as part of this project. We tried to integrate various aspects such as Epistemology of Technology, Media Theory, Human Psychology, and other aspects which could be crucial for the understanding of VR as a new medium. Our final prototype could stand out to be an Avant-Garde film in VR which could help to define the visual, aesthetic and experiential grammar of the medium.
