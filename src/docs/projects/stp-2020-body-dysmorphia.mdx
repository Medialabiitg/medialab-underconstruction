Body Dysmorphic Disorder is a very common mental disorder that affects 1 in every 50 people around the globe. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), one may become diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder if they have a strong obsession with one or more perceived defects or flaws in their physical appearance that are not visible or appear minor to others. These perceived flaws can cause the individual to feel ugly, abnormal, hideous or monster-like.
Due to the rise in social media and itâ€™s easy accessibility to people belonging to various demographics, one is exposed to typical standards of beauty from a very young age which in many cases leaves a hard impression on them for a very long time. People affected by Body Dysmorphic Disorder go through severe social anxiety in many cases which eventually leads to them leaving their academics and/or jobs.
Very often those who go through mental disorders find it difficult to seek help either because of the lack of knowledge about the available options for reaching out or due to the social stigma associated with it. This project aims at shedding light on Body Dysmorphic Disorder and its effects. This project also takes one through the journeys towards seeking help and thus encouraging those suffering from it to take the necessary steps to recovery.
