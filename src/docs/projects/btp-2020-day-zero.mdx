*dystopia, totalitarianism, social constructs, graphic novel, illustrations*

<br/><br/>

For years Iâ€™ve wondered, where are we going? What is our future headed towards?
Through the medium of a graphic novel, I am exploring a dystopian world, within the framework of a totalitarian government. The protagonist is a representation of our collective thinking right now and represents my ideologies and emotions. The events of the graphic novel are set after the events of the present day, after a huge chunk of the world population is gone as a result of war and climate change.
